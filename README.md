# Airline Manager

The most realistic Airline Manager mobile game. The game is running on Android & iOS. 

A project for Kiwi.com Mobile Challenge.

## General information

The Airline Manager is a singleplayer mobile game. You can manage your airline in real-time. My vision is create a version, where players can compete and play together. You will be able to buy a slot at your favorite airport, manage board services and areas (economy, business, first-class).     

Top current features
* Realtime flight view
* Buy and sell airplanes
* Claim special flight offers
* Earn virtual coins
* See your stats

Business plan
 * Virtual coins and gems - you can buy them with real-life money. With coins, you can buy and level-up your airplanes. Using gems you can speedup airplanes on the flight, buy super limited premium airplanes, or buy XP to level up. You can easily exchange gems for coins.
* In-app advertising - provide ad banner on the airplanes for real-life airlines. For example, you can buy an airplane SmartWings Airbus A330 in the game.
* Airplane skin - gold airplanes, custom paintings
